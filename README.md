#  Germany vs EU Energy Trends (1990â€“2023)

A comparative data analysis visualising how Germany and the European Union (EUâ€‘27) have shifted their energy mix from **fossil fuels** to **renewables** over the past three decades.

---

##  Project Overview

This project explores the transition in energy sources using data from Eurostat (nrg_bal_c), focusing on:

- Annual energy consumption by type (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, bioenergy, wind, solar, hydro, geothermal)
- Trends in Germany vs EUâ€‘27 from 1990 to 2023
- Visualisations that reveal shifts from fossil fuels to cleaner renewables

---

##  Data Source

- **Eurostat** â€“ *Energy Balances (nrg_bal_c)*  
  Filters applied:  
  - Geography: **Germany**, **European Union â€“ 27 countries (from 2020)**  
  - Time: **1990â€“2023**  
  - Metric: **Gross inland consumption (ktoe)**

### Key Insights from Germany Energy Mix (1990â€“2023)

- ðŸ”» **Solid fossil fuel** consumption has steadily dropped by over 60%.
- ðŸ”¼ **Renewables like Wind and Bioenergy** show a consistent rise â€” Wind especially after 2005.
- ðŸ”š **Nuclear energy** use dropped to zero by 2023, reflecting Germanyâ€™s phase-out strategy.
- âš¡ Natural gas remains relatively stable, with some fluctuation post-2010.

ðŸ‘‰ These changes highlight Germanyâ€™s aggressive energy transition policies toward renewables.
