#  Germany vs EU Energy Trends (1990–2023)

A comparative data analysis visualising how Germany and the European Union (EU‑27) have shifted their energy mix from **fossil fuels** to **renewables** over the past three decades.

---

##  Project Overview

This project explores the transition in energy sources using data from Eurostat (nrg_bal_c), focusing on:

- Annual energy consumption by type (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, bioenergy, wind, solar, hydro, geothermal)
- Trends in Germany vs EU‑27 from 1990 to 2023
- Visualisations that reveal shifts from fossil fuels to cleaner renewables

---

##  Data Source

- **Eurostat** – *Energy Balances (nrg_bal_c)*  
  Filters applied:  
  - Geography: **Germany**, **European Union – 27 countries (from 2020)**  
  - Time: **1990–2023**  
  - Metric: **Gross inland consumption (ktoe)**
